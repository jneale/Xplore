          <h2>Release notes</h2>

          <h3>Version 4.9</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Added two new options to history items to open them in a new tab or share them via encoded URL.
            Large links can be pasted directly into the script editor where they will be loaded automatically.</li>
            <li>Added a "Copy to Clipboard" link on the Output pane for easy copying of the result table.</li>
            <li>Added padding to log message milliseconds so they line up nicely.</li>
            <li>Added option to disable "Ctrl + S" shortcut.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where object property names would be not be shown in the results.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where JSON user data would show up as "[object Object]" when loading from history.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug caused by User Data Format being set but no user data being given.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where result properties names containing HTML/JavaScript were being executed when added to the result table.</li>
            <li>Fixed the contrast on keyword elements.</li>
            <li>General theming improvements.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Version 4.8</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>(beta) Added support for themes! The themes have been adapted from CodeMirror
              themes to with Xplore so some work better than others.</li>
            <li>Added script execution history. Each time you open Xplore, a new session is
              started and your script is saved when you run it. By default, 50 sessions
              are stored, but you can change this number using a system property. This is
              user specific.</li>
            <li>Settings from within Xplore are now able to be saved so they are loaded the next
              time Xplore is opened. This is user specific.</li>
            <li>Added automatic link recognition to Xplore output. Reference fields, links, and
              table.sys_id values are automatically converted to clickable links.</li>
            <li>Added support for function hoisting in the Editor. Note this is disabled by default but
              can be enabled from Xplore settings.</li>
            <li>Reorganised the main information window and about section and included release notes.</li>
            <li>Overhauled the Logs menu to include many more contextual links for logs generated
              during the last script execution, as well as shortcut links to logs just generated today.</li>
            <li>Added Select2 to Target and Scope selectors to make them easier to use.</li>
            <li>Improved the gs log behaviour to work as close to native as possible. gs.debug(), gs.info(),
              gs.warn() and gs.error() can now take 6 arguments while gs.log() will take 2 and gs.print() just 1.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where opening a list with an encoded query containing single quotes would
              not work because it was not properly escaped.</li>
            <li>Minor improvements to Xplore processor.</li>
            <li>Changed blacklist to ignorelist and redlist to warnlist.</li>
            <li>Updated JSON implementation.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug with the Table Heirarchy generating an undefined exception.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where user data would not format properly when formatted within a scope.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug with RegExp not showing unmatched alternative groups.</li>
            <li>Fixed a UI issue with the header on narrower screens.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where results might not be shown during scoped script execution.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that prevented Ctrl+D (select next occurrence) from working in the editor.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Version 4.7</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Prevent Ctrl+Enter inserting new line in code.</li>
            <li>Add support for Ctrl+S to execute the script.</li>
            <li>Detect objects passed to gs.log/gs.info/gs.error/gs.debug and jslog methods and display them as JSON. (Server processing only applies when Fix Logs option is enabled.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Script Editor</h2>
          <p>Use the script editor on the left to write and run scripts
            in ServiceNow, much like a background script, but
            supercharged. The last object in the script will be shown
            here in a detailed output tab.</p>
          <p>Use the choice list to choose where you want to run your
            code, either server or client.</p>
          <p>Launching Xplore from within ServiceNow will give you
            access to the various frames ServiceNow uses.</p>

          <p>Simply type in your expression and a test string, give
            it a second, and it will automatically test your expression

      <div class="panel" id="i_tips">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <h4>Logging</h4>
          <p>Xplore supports capturing server messages using the
            following native ServiceNow logging functions:</p>
          <ul class="list-example">
            <li><code>gs.log("Hello world")</code></li>
            <li><code>gs.print("Hello world")</code></li>
            <li><code>gs.info("Hello world")</code></li>
            <li><code>gs.warn("Hello world")</code></li>
            <li><code>gs.error("Hello world")</code></li>
            <li><code>gs.addInfoMessage("Hello world")</code></li>
            <li><code>gs.addErrorMessage("Hello world")</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some server exceptions result in the transaction being aborted by
            ServiceNow which means you will have limited (if any) output.
            Xplore helps with this by automatically retrieving
            the session log statements that were generated up to the time of the error
           (using the functions shown above) and showing them in the output pane.
          </p>

          <p>Client side logs can be captured as well:</p>
          <ul class="list-example">
            <li><code>jslog("Hello world")</code></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Script Include</h4>
          <p>Xplore is based on a global Script Include that you can
            run anywhere in ServiceNow.</p>

          <p><code>new snd_Xplore().xplore(obj /*, reporter, options */)</code></p>
          <p class="col-xs-12">Iterate over any object to retrieve its contents.
            Optionally provide a reporter and options. The default reporter will
            print everything using gs.print(). This page uses a custom print
            reporter to generate JSON and package it all back to the client
            over AJAX.</p>

          <p><code>new snd_Xplore().lookAt(obj /*, name, show_strings */)</code></p>
          <p class="col-xs-12">The magic method that works out what any object
            is and even attempts to find it's contents.</p>

          <p><code>snd_Xplore.ignorelist('illegalName')</code></p>
          <p class="col-xs-12">Ignore-listed properties are those that throw illegal
            access exceptions. ServiceNow don't even want you trying to access these,
            let alone see their value. Xplore has a built in template to filter the
            majority of these, but sometimes they will slip through. Bypass these
            properties on the fly, or add the property to the 'ignorelist' array
            in the snd_xplore Script Include.</p>

          <p><code>snd_Xplore.warnlist('illegalType')</code></p>
          <p class="col-xs-12">Warn-listed types are for objects that don't have a
            toString function associated. These can throw errors, so you might not
            want to show them.</p>
